Changes file for the 2019 series

This reflects changes to MMA since the release of version 19.07.

BUG: When running on windows a crash occurred since there is a not a fcntl
 module. This was used only when writing a buffer to a log file in *nix/mac.
 MMA now discards the option on Windows.
 
LYRICS are now permitted in repeat lines. If it is a "real" lyric, the
 text is ignored for repeated lines; if the CHORD option is enabled
 each line will contain correct chord info. Note: repeat lines are
 those set with the " * count" option.

The MIDI voice "DistortionGuitar" has been improperly spelled
 "DistoronGuitar" since very early versions of MMA (note the
 missing "i"). This is fixed, and the wrong spelling still works.

With the -d switch on LibPath caused an error. Fixed.

Leading zeros ('0') are now permitted and ignored in label line
 numbers. Permits line numbers like '001', '002', etc. to work with
 the -b option.

Added $_FilePath and $_SongPath variables. These, plus $_FileName will
 return '' (an empty string) if input is coming from STDIN.

Source lines terminated with LF/CR combinations have been converted to
 "unix" style (LF only). In the future, please submit ONLY files to
 the author in this format. MMA doesn't care, but 'patch' and other
 git programs do.
 
Minor documentation fixes and internal source comment clearifications/fixes.

August 4, 2019 - released version 19.08
