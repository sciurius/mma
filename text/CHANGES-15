Changes file for the 2015 series

This reflects changes to MMA since the release of version 15.01.

================================

Added macro variables $_Track_Delay, $_Track_HarmonyOnly,
  $_Track_MidiVolume and $_Track_StrumAdd.

Fixed bugs in GRACE notes. When fixing the code which ensured that all
  the notes in a chord ended up with the same duration, we forgot that
  GRACE notes were supposed to be different. Well, they are now!

Harmony was NOT being applied to chords with grace notes. Fixed.

Solo note volume adjustments weren't working properly.

February 8, 2015
Released 15.01a

---------------------------------------------

Added RPITCH command. Modifies notes on-the-fly for random "mistakes".
 Actually makes some bass lines, etc sound quite natural. See the
 docs for details.

Added donated instrument file for Roland-mt32 in includes. Thanks 
 so much Hanno Behrens!

Added alternate spelling for TRANSPOSE and LYRICS TRANSPOSE. Both now accept
 interval syntax like "Up Minor Third", etc.

May 13, 2015
Released 15.01b

---------------------------------------------------


Added Subroutines. See the manual for details. This could be quite useful.


May 19, 2015
Released 15.01c

----------------------------------------------------

Fixed Transpose so that "Up Major 2" is the same as "Up Major Second".

Fixed the warning messages for slash chords so that things like C/B
 do not print warnings. The manual for slash chords has been
 (hopefully) clarified.

In the manual and code the COMPRESS option took values 0 (off), 1, ... 5.
 I have no idea why. The actual code only compresses once and the value
 is ignored. Docs and code are updated to reflect reality.

July 10, 2015
Released 15.01d

----------------------------------------------------------

Added Lyric option On or Off.

Fixed import error for python3.

Added fretnoise option in plectrum tracks. See the docs and a short
 example in egs/misc.

August 29, 2015
Released 15.01f

------------------------------------------------------------

Added -L option to report label/lines proceesed order.

CHANGED fretnoise strings are now numbered in the correct mode.
 String 1 is the highest sounding, just like a real guitar.

BUGFIX: fretnoise now looks for chord change instead of just string change.

September 9, 2015
Released  15.01g

Released 15-09

---------------------------------------------------------------


Modified -L option to show '?' for bars without labels.

Fixed MIDIINC which was crashing when importing a file with lyrics.

Fixed longstanding bug in the html docs which didn't show the MMA
 logo. A simple path issue. Thanks Anthony Fok.

Change to mma-gb so that that the database file is now stored 
 in ~/.cache (user's local directory). Thanks Anthony Fok.

Changes to mma-splitrec to make it work with python3. Thanks
 Anthony Fok.

The -G option now force deletes existing .mmaDB files. Should solve a
 problem with out-of-control recursion when a database is really
 screwed up.

Added $_TimeSig variable.

The TIME command has been expanded to include the option to set
  the time signature and a new concept of "Chord Tabs". This
  should make life easier if you use "odd" times and/or use
  notation editors to read MMA putput.

Note durations can be specified as tuplet ratios. An 8th note triplet
  could always be set as '3', you can now use '3:4'. No biggie, but
  you can also do stuff like '6:1' ( one sixth of a whole note).

Added new macro $_NoteLen(note). Returns the duration
  of the note in MIDI ticks.
