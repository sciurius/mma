Changes file for the 2020 series

This reflects changes to MMA since the release of version 20.02 (February 2020).

Fixed several spelling errors in the man pages. Thanks to Dennis Braun.

Fixed major problem with plugins crashing with Python3. Easy fix :)

Changed the default behaviour of Plectrum tracks: they no longer turn off
  all sounding strings when a groove is changed. This can be restored via
  the Tweaks PlectrumDoRest=True or Off setting.

Fixed minor problem with keysigs always being "#" in a MIDI file.
  Thanks to Jason Crane.
