This reflects changes to MMA since the release of version 16.06.

Minor change to pluginUtils.py so that 16.06 is recognized.

There was an import error in regpluy.py which showed only when using python 3.x. Fixed

Fixed AFTER option parser. You can now have option pairs in the command to execute.

At some point I added a '5' option as a chord for so-called "power chords".
 This chordtype dropped the 3rd and duplicated in a 2nd 5th. Worked just fine.
 Then I added in '#5' as an alternate spelling for '+' or 'alt'. Now we have problems!
 I actually needed a '#5' (to accomodate a decending bass line) and used 'F#5'. Opps,
 it used a power-chord F# (and left the 5 alone). So, it's now changed ... for a
 explicit '#5' use the notation '(#5)'. Or, easier, just use 'alt' or '+'.

DefaultDrum now also works with Solo/Melody tracks when the drumtype option is
 set. Please read the cautions in the manual when you play with the
 "Tweaks DefaultDrum" option.

September 10, 2916: Released 11.06.a
