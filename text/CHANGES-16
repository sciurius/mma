Changes file for the 2016 series

This reflects changes to MMA since the release of version 16.06.

Minor change to pluginUtils.py so that 16.06 is recognized. 

June 12, 2016: Reposted 16.06 packages. Silent fix.

There was an import error in regpluy.py which showed only when using python 3.x. Fixed

June 14, 2016: Reposted 16.06 packages. Silent fix (but posted message).

Fixed AFTER option parser. You can now have option pairs in the command to execute.

At some point I added a '5' option as a chord for so-called "power chords".
 This chordtype dropped the 3rd and duplicated in a 2nd 5th. Worked just fine.
 Then I added in '#5' as an alternate spelling for '+' or 'alt'. Now we have problems!
 I actually needed a '#5' (to accomodate a decending bass line) and used 'F#5'. Opps,
 it used a power-chord F# (and left the 5 alone). So, it's now changed ... for a
 explicit '#5' use the notation '(#5)'. Or, easier, just use 'alt' or '+'.

DefaultDrum now also works with Solo/Melody tracks when the drumtype option is
 set. Please read the cautions in the manual when you play with the
 "Tweaks DefaultDrum" option.

September 10, 2016: Released 11.06.a

Added Min:Sec to report string (in addition to Min.ddd). Hope it's useful to someone.

Fixed bug in HTML doc generator. It was crashing with plectrum mute patterns.

The descriptions of a defined groove (for the docs) will always end in a '.'.

Fixed docs for the 'r' Direction setting in Aria. 'r*' was confusing.

Fixed error in the COPY command. Using extended groove/track notation was not working.

Enhanced the COPY command to support copying from to to a different track.

Added interval harmonies: Sxxx. See the fine manual.

Fixed bug in solo/melody tracks: the note middle C was never being
 harmonized (note: there really is a difference between the value 0 and None!)
